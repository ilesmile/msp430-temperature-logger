# msp430-temperature-logger
Temperature logger based on MSP430G52553 and Dallas D18B20 temperature sensor

This is work in progress (and may perpetually stay such)


Use DS18B20 for measuring temeprature and looging. 
MSP430 is kept in low-power mode and awaken only when logging needs to be performed.
